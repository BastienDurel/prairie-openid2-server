In search for a lightweight openid server, i found prairie at 
http://www.barnraiser.org/prairie

to suit the need : 
-	Using subdomain as openid identities makes identity simple to remember and type in. 
-	Contains an profile page connected to your identity, that is useful when commenting posts on others blogs etc using your openid identity. 

However, the project is closed down, and during install of the alpha 0.2 release, i discovered that it needed some more development to function properly. 

-	Not fully openid2 compatible
-	Lacks implementation of openid.mode=checkid_immediate
-	The profile-editor needed an wysiwyg editor to be more user friendly 

I have done some development work on it that should be public available as the original source from http://www.barnraiser.org/prairie

I thought of using github repository here in case some others wants to attend the further development of this system. 

Changes to this version: 
-	Implemented the mode “openid.mode=checkid_immediate”. Changes in the class Openid.class.php, trust.php and index.php
-	Change in index.php to prevent login screen to appear if already logged on when using your openID. 
-	Change in wrapper.tpl.php to include link header for “openid2.provider”, and included script for the tiny_mce editor. 
-	Change in editor.tpl.php to use tiny_mce editor
---------------
Updates
- 	Fixed UTC time zone in nonce (using gmdate instead of date) - file class/Openid.class.php
- 	Fixed support for $openid_identity == 'http://specs.openid.net/auth/2.0/identifier_select' - since there is only one per subdomain, it just throws in the url for your subdomain.
